** ZOOL 143 - BIOLOGY OF HIV & AIDS **

HIV FUNDAMENTALS:
- HIV = Human Immunodeficiency Virus, a retrovirus that causes AIDS
- Other names: Human T cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-III), Lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV), AIDS associated retrovirus (ARV)
- AIDS = Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, characterized by CD4 count <200 cells/μl or CD4 percentage below 14%
- HIV is preventable, manageable but not curable
- Normal CD4 count: 500-1200 cells/μl; concerning range: 500-200 cells/μl

HIV STRUCTURE & ORGANIZATION:
- Enveloped retrovirus of lentivirus subfamily
- Lipid envelope with glycoprotein spikes: gp120 (binds CD4 receptors) and gp41 (mediates membrane fusion)
- Viral core contains p24 capsid protein
- Contains two identical strands of single-stranded RNA
- Critical enzymes: Reverse Transcriptase, Integrase, Protease
- Matrix protein p17 provides structural support

HIV LIFE CYCLE (7 STAGES):
1. BINDING: HIV binds to CD4+ surface receptor on T-cells; blocked by entry/fusion inhibitors
2. REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION: Viral RNA converted to DNA by reverse transcriptase; blocked by NRTIs and NNRTIs
3. INTEGRATION: Viral DNA incorporated into host genome by integrase; blocked by integrase inhibitors
4. TRANSCRIPTION: Viral DNA transcribed to mRNA; can be blocked by transcription inhibitors
5. TRANSLATION: mRNA translated into viral proteins
6. ASSEMBLY: New viral particles assembled
7. MATURATION: Viral proteins processed by protease; blocked by protease inhibitors
- Latent HIV can persist for years without replication

DISEASE PROGRESSION STAGES:
1. ACUTE HIV INFECTION (2-4 weeks post-exposure):
   - High viral load, very infectious
   - Flu-like symptoms: fever, chills, rash, night sweats, muscle aches, sore throat, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes
   - Detectable only by antigen/antibody tests or NATs

2. CHRONIC HIV INFECTION/CLINICAL LATENCY:
   - Asymptomatic period lasting years to decades
   - HIV reproduces at low levels
   - People can transmit HIV
   - With ART, may never progress to Stage 3

3. SYMPTOMATIC HIV INFECTION:
   - Persistent swollen lymph nodes
   - Weight loss, recurrent fever
   - Extreme fatigue and other infections

4. AIDS (CD4 <200 cells/μl or opportunistic infections):
   - Severely damaged immune system
   - Multiple opportunistic infections
   - Without treatment: survival ~3 years

ORIGIN THEORIES OF HIV:
1. MYSTERIOUS ORIGINS: Comet tail theory (viral material from space)
2. RELIGIOUS THEORIES: God's wrath or witchcraft
3. MONKEY ORIGIN THEORIES: Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) crossover from chimpanzees
4. CONSPIRACY THEORIES: Man-made biological warfare
5. CALCULATION THEORY: Computer analysis suggests origin around 1930 in Central Africa

THEORIES ON SPECIES CROSSOVER:
1. ORAL POLIO VACCINE (OPV) THEORY: Chat vaccine grown in chimp kidney cells
2. HUNTER'S THEORY: SIV transferred through hunting/butchering chimps
3. CONTAMINATED NEEDLE THEORY: Reuse of unsterilized syringes in medical programs
4. COLONIALISM THEORY: Harsh labor camps with poor sanitation and nutrition

HISTORICAL CHRONOLOGY:
- 1959: First known sample from Congo patient

- 2017: "Undetectable = Untransmittable" (U=U) concept endorsed

HIV TESTING AND DIAGNOSIS:
- WINDOW PERIOD: 4-6 weeks after infection when antibodies not detectable
- Confirmation testing required at 3 months post-exposure
- TEST TYPES:
  1. Antibody tests (blood or saliva) - detect HIV antibodies
  2. Antigen/antibody tests - detect both p24 antigen and antibodies
  3. Nucleic acid tests (RNA tests) - detect viral RNA directly (10 days post-exposure)
  4. OraQuick In-Home HIV Test - oral swab, results in 20 minutes
  5. Home Access HIV-1 Test System - finger prick blood sample
  6. ELISA test - screening test for HIV antibodies
